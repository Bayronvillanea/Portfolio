        <p className='about-p'>currently student of Software engineering.
I am passionate about web development<br/> and that's why every day I try to develop my skills as front-end.<br/>
I am an autodidactic person and most of the knowledge<br/> I have learned it by reading  documents , different courses and platforms.<br/>
Learning about technology by my own has taught me that all is about<br/> setting goals and try to achieve even if I have to start hundreds of times.</p>
